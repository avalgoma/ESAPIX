# ESAPIX Documentation
ESAPIX is an open source extension library for the Varian Medical Systems Eclipse Scripting API (ESAPI). By adding this library to your ESAPI apps, you will gain some extra functionality to **ninjafy** your code.
ESAPIX is built by Rex Cardan, Ph.D. at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. This section contains examples and the API documentation. 
## Quick Start Notes:
